# Module_14_Algo_Bot

## The purpose of this program is to create an algo trading bot that responds to signals using the dual moving avg crossover (DMAC) strategy. 

=================================================
### Original Plot (Baseline performance):

### Plot after increasing training period to 6 months. Improved recall. Model is more predictive than original through late 2018, but appears to be less predictive for more recent dates:

### Plot after returning training period to 3 months, but changing short_window SMA to 10 days and long_window SMA to 150 days. This model appears most representative of actual returns:

### Plot using Logistic Regression model:

## Conclusion: The most predictive model created was the svm model using the baseline 3 month training period and a short window SMA of 10 days and a long window SMA of 150 days. The logistic regression model was inadequate as an alternative model.
